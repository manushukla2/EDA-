### Obesity Level Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the obesity level of individuals based on various features such as age, gender, height, weight, and lifestyle habits. The prediction task is treated as a classification problem.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about individuals' demographics, lifestyle habits, and obesity levels. It includes features such as age, gender, height, weight, frequency of physical activity, and water consumption.

## Data Preprocessing
- Categorical columns were label-encoded.
- Continuous columns were standardized using StandardScaler.

## Data Visualization
- Visualized the distribution of ages and the relationship with family history of being overweight using violin plots.
- Created a correlation heatmap to analyze relationships between features.

## Algorithms Used
Several classification algorithms were evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (Best Performing)
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine

## Evaluation
The Random Forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of 96.4%.

## Files Included
